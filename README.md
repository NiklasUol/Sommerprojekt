# Sommerprojekt
This code is for your university summer project

WHAT THE PROJECT DOES
  Our project is a clock that helps you to wake up. It does that by only being able to turned off by pushing a button that is far away from the clock. 

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL
  With this placement of clock and off-button, we intend to force your users to walk, which makes you more wack and decreases the chance that you lay yourself back into your bed.

HOW USERS CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT
  Since we tinkered a bit of hardware to getter to build our own clock, it mid be a bit difficult to start right a way. 
  clock and the off-switch consists of a Wemos D1 Mini each, for control and for Wi-Fi capability, an 8-Ohm speaker, button: VS15 and an HT16K33 Display from Adafruit.

WHO MAINTAINS AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE PROJECT & WHERE CAN I GET HELP ?
  This project was created and is maintained by Renke Beckmann, Minh Duc Pham, Niklas Schmidt and Jan von Garrel.
