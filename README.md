WHAT THE PROJECT DOES
  Our projekt is a clock that helps yout to wacke up. It does that by only beeing able to turned off by pushing a button that is far away from clock. 

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL
  With this placment of clock and off-button we intend to force your users to walk, which makes you more awack an decreses the chance that you lay yourself back into your bed.

HOW USERS CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT
  Since we tinkered a bit of hardware to getter to bouild our own clock, it mid be a bit difficould to start right a way. 
  clock and the off-switch consists of a Wemos D1 Mini each, for controll and for wifi capability, a 8-Ohm speaker, button: VS15 and an HT16K33 Display form Adafruit.
